# Terrian-Classification  
A software to run the basic algorithms in classification  of ground objects in satellite images.  
 Include   
       1.Mahalanobis Distance  
       2.Back Propagation Neural Network  
       
 The Application Sample:

   We select 5 features of the ground objects, and we combine 6 bands from the satellite images to  
   form a 6-dimension vector as an input for classification.
